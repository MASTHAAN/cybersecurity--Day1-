Day 1 — Cybersecurity.
1. Hacker Methodologies & Testing Types
1.1 White-Hat Methodology — 10 steps
Legal documentation — Prepare NDA, MOU (scope), and payment terms.

Scope assessment — Define targets, allowed tests, and exclusions (e.g., no phishing).

Information gathering — Collect OS, software, services, open ports, public info.

Vulnerability assessment — Scan with tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) to find weaknesses.

Penetration testing — Attempt to exploit confirmed vulnerabilities.

Gaining access — Achieve initial foothold (user-level).

Privilege escalation — Move from user to admin/root if possible.

Report generation — Document findings, severity, and recommended fixes.

Patch assistance — Help stakeholders understand/fix issues.

Revalidation — Re-test to verify fixes were effective.

1.2 Black-Hat Methodology — 6 steps (malicious)
Information gathering

Vulnerability analysis

Penetration attempts

Gaining access

Privilege escalation

Clearing traces (covering tracks)

1.3 Penetration testing types — by information level
White box — Full internal info (insider simulation).

Black box — No prior info (external attacker simulation).

Gray box — Partial info (semi-insider simulation).

1.4 Penetration testing types — by location
External testing — Remote; fast and cost-effective.

Internal testing — On-site; better for high-sensitivity systems and monitoring.

2. Computer Networks — quick steps
Definition: Two or more devices connected to exchange data.

Purpose: file sharing, resource sharing, communication.

By geographic area:

LAN — Local (home/office), high speed, low cost.

MAN — City-wide, medium speed/cost.

WAN — Country/global, higher cost, variable speed.

By accessibility:

External (public) — e.g., public Wi-Fi.

Internal (restricted) — e.g., corporate networks, CCTV.

3. Servers & Data Packets — step notes
Server: System that provides services/data (like a waiter).

Client: System that requests services/data.

Client-Server model: Clients send requests → Servers respond.

Data packets: Messages broken into packets for efficient transfer and reassembly.

Common server types (for each, note features, pros/cons, applications):

Web server (HTTP/S)

Mail server (SMTP/IMAP/POP)

Proxy server

Application server

FTP server

Telnet server (legacy—avoid for security)

Real-time communication server (WebRTC/SIP)

List server (mailing lists)

Open-source server platforms (Linux-based)

Virtual server (VMs / containers)

4. Assignments — step-by-step approach
A. Types of Servers: Features, pros/cons, and applications
List server types (use the list above).

For each server write:

Key features (protocols, ports, core function).

Pros (cost, scalability, performance).

Cons (security risks, maintenance).

Applications / examples (real-world uses).

Compare 2–3 server types in a short table (features vs. pros/cons).

Cite examples or screenshots (if required).

B. Qualities of a Hacker: Mindset & skills required
Mindset (list and define): curiosity, persistence, ethical thinking (for white-hat), attention to detail, patience.

Core skills: networking (TCP/IP), OS internals (Linux/Windows), scripting (Python/Bash), web tech (HTTP, SQL), cryptography basics, common tools (Nmap, Burp, OWASP ZAP).

Soft skills: reporting, communication, documentation, responsible disclosure.

Action plan: pick one skill, practice with a CTF/problem for 1 week, document results.
